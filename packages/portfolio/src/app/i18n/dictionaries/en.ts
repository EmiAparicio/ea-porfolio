        "This portfolio is a project in its own, designed to showcase a set of web development skills. Built with <b>Next.js</b>, it prioritizes search engine optimization (SEO) through <i>server-side rendering (SSR)</i>, complemented by client-side routing for a seamless, wait-free navigation experience. The user journey is enriched with interactive elements, from <b>dynamic button audio</b> and <b>Framer Motion animations</b> to custom visual effects crafted with Canvas and SVG.<br/><br/>The project's architecture is built to be robust and scalable. For global state management, it leverages <b>Jotai</b>, including persistence with <i>sessionStorage</i> to optimize the user experience. Styling combines both <b>native CSS and Tailwind v4</b>. Most components were build from scratch, while some use the <b>Radix UI</b> library. The multilingual structure is natively implemented, inspired by <b>i18n</b> for full content control.<br/><br/>Additionally, the project demonstrates a focus on <b>real-time performance measurement</b> and continuous improvement. It also reflects my current work methodology, where I leverage <i>artificial intelligence</i> to solve complex problems and accelerate the development cycle, allowing me to create more efficient and high-quality solutions.",
